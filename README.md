# ttracker
Old tracker torrent I work on from time to time,
you need curl, sqlite3 in order to compile it.
Works on FreeBSD, macOS, should work on Linux too.

there are some warnings about unused parameters, I will fix them sooner or later

build: make all
run: ./ttracker
remove object files: make clean
